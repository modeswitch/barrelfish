ARM on Gem5 usage and installation instructions:

1. Build barrelfish for Gem5 (see barrelfish wiki for further instructions)

2. Extract and install the gem5 simulator provided here (note you have to use this release to get a working environment out of the box)

3. Change to your gem5 directory and apply 'system.cc.patch' and 'RealView.py.patch' to the gem5 source code

4. Build gem5 with 'scons build/ARM/gem5.fast' and add the binary to the PATH

5. In your barrelfish build directory use 'gem5.fast ../tools/gem5/gem5script.py --kernel=gem5/sbin/cpu --ramdisk=gem5/romfs.cpio' to run barrelfish on gem5

6. To get the output of barrelfish you can use 'telnet localhost 3456'

NOTE 1: You can print the supported options of the gem5 script with 'gem5.fast ../tools/gem5/gem5script.py -h'
NOTE 2: If you use --cpu-type=arm_detailed, the simulation takes a long time (up to an hour just to boot barrelfish)

ARM on Gem5 usage and installation instructions:

1. Build Barrelfish for Arm on Gem5 (see Barrelfish wiki for further instructions)

2. If you are a member of ETH or Microsoft Research with access to the Barrelfish development tools continue with point 6 otherwise do steps 3 to 5

3. Extract and install the gem5 simulator provided on the Barrelfish website (note you have to use this release to get a working environment out of the box)

4. Change to your gem5 directory and apply 'system.cc.patch','RealView.py.patch' and 'gic.cc.patch', located in '/path/to/barrelfish/tools/arm_gem5' to the gem5 source code

5. Build gem5 with 'scons build/ARM/gem5.fast' and add the binary to the PATH (if you have troubles compiling gem5, try an older version of gcc)

6. In your Barrelfish build directory use 'gem5.fast ../tools/gem5/gem5script.py --kernel=gem5/sbin/cpu --ramdisk=gem5/romfs.cpio' to run Barrelfish on gem5

7. To get the output of Barrelfish you can use 'telnet localhost 3456'

NOTE 1: You can print the supported options of the gem5 script with 'gem5.fast ../tools/gem5/gem5script.py -h'
NOTE 2: If you use --cpu-type=arm_detailed, the simulation takes a long time (up to an hour just to boot Barrelfish)
